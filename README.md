## Introduction
UpFit is a fitness application designed to help individuals track their meals, monitor their calorie intake, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. The application caters to four different types of users: admin, coach, basic user, and premium user. Each user type has specific functionalities and privileges within the application. 

## Application Implementation
The application was developed in Visual Studio 2022 using the ASP.net Core Web App (Model-View Controller) template. We started by defining the necessary classes/models. We used Entity Framework and code-first approach.  We implemented the controllers to handle user requests and actions, and designed the views to provide a user-friendly interface.
The application consists of several folders, each serving a specific purpose: 
1. Controllers: This folder contains the controllers that handle user requests, process data, and control the flow of the 
application. Controllers interact with the models and views to perform various actions. 
2. Migrations: The Migrations folder stores database migration files generated by Entity Framework. These files track changes 
to the database schema over time, allowing for easy database updates and version control. 
3. Models: The Models folder holds the model classes that represent the entities and data structures within the application. 
These classes define properties, relationships, and business logic related to the data. 
4. Views: The Views folder contains the user interface templates that display information to the users. Views are responsible 
for rendering data and presenting it in a visually appealing and interactive manner. 
5. VideoFiles: This folder is specifically dedicated to storing video files used within the application. It will contain videos 
related to exercises, tutorials, or any other multimedia content.

## Database Design
The application has a well-structured database design to effectively manage data and support its various functionalities. The 
database consists of eight tables, each serving a specific purpose: 
1. Admins Table: 
• Stores the credentials of administrators. 
• Contains columns such as ID (identifier), Username, and Password. 
2. Coaches Table: 
• Stores the credentials of coaches. 
• Contains columns such as ID, Username, and Password. 
3. Videos Table: 
• Stores information about uploaded videos. 
• Includes columns such as ID, Name (video title), Path (file path), and CoachFK (foreign key) 
4. FoodTypes Table: 
• Stores different types of food categories. 
• Contains columns such as ID and Name (e.g., fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, seeds). 
5. Foods Table: 
• Stores detailed information about individual food items. 
• Includes columns such as ID, TypeFK (foreign key referencing the corresponding food type), Name, Calories, 
Proteins, Fats, Carbs, Fibers, and various vitamin fields (A, B, C, D, E). 
6. MealTypes Table: 
• Stores different meal types, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
• Contains columns such as ID and Name. 
7. Meals Table: 
• Represents individual meal instances recorded by users. 
• Includes columns such as ID, MealtypeFK (foreign key referencing the meal type), UserFK (foreign key referencing 
the associated user), FoodFK (foreign key referencing the consumed food), Quantity, and Date.
